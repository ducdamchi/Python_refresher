About: This project reads from a dictionary to create a simple 2-player word game in Python.

***** Instructions *****

In Shell: python3 word-scramble.py

Both players will be given a same list of 7 letters. They then take turns to guess as many English words as they can based on the guidelines.
The program will decide which words are invalid, calculate the final score, and decide the winner.
