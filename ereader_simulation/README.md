About: This project implements Classes in Python to create an e-reader simulation in a PowerShell.

***** Instructions *****

To run, type in shell: python3 ereader.py

The program will pre-load a small selection of ebooks and prompts the reader with the following options:

    Buy/See available books
    See owned books
    Read a book
    Exit

The user can then navigate freely among these options (until they exit), creating a primitive experience of using an e-reader like Kindle.
