About: This simple project is a practice on writing recursive functions in Python, and provides comparison to its iterative counterparts.

***** Instructions *****

To run these two separate programs, type in shell: 
python3 math-functions.py 
python3 vowels.pu

The first program computes the sum of some subgroups of integers, iteratively and recursively.
The second program disemvowels a string recursively.
